## Iris Dataset Classifier Exploration

This project explores the well-known Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of three flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. I selected petal length and width as features due to their clear class separation and minimal preprocessing requirements.

The primary goal was to better understand how different classification algorithms — such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines — behave under different hyperparameter settings. I focused on visualizing their decision boundaries and observing how model complexity impacts overfitting and underfitting.

### Key Concepts:
- Model tuning and interpretation
- Visual comparison of classifiers
- Recognizing signs of overfitting vs underfitting

All experiments were done in a clean, minimal setting to focus on the model behavior itself.
